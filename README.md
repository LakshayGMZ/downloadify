This project uses reactJS as frontend and flask as backend this time.

## Steps to run the program locally
### backend
```shell
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
cd ..
```

### Frontend
```shell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

# Reason I pushed this simple project to Github

I haven't used prebuilt libraries and packages in backend but made it from scratch. Backend uses just requests lib and web scraping method to scrape the video playback urls. Each and every line of backend is coded by me
